## 🛣️ Future Roadmap

This project has a strong foundation, and several exciting features are planned to enhance its capabilities and provide even greater value.

-   ### 📋 **Excel / CSV Data Import (High Priority)**
    -   **Description**: The next major feature will be the ability to **upload attendance data directly from an Excel or CSV file**, typically generated by a fingerprint or biometric attendance machine. This will completely automate the data entry process.
    -   **Vision**: A "drag-and-drop" interface for instant file processing, intelligent column mapping, and a validation step before saving the data.

-   ### 🔐 **Authentication & Advanced User Roles**
    -   **Description**: Implement a secure login system to protect sensitive payroll data. Introduce user roles such as **Admin** and **Manager** to establish an access control hierarchy.
    -   **Vision**: Integration with **NextAuth.js** for robust authentication. Admins will have full control, while Managers might have read-only access or permissions limited to their specific teams.

-   ### 📈 **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**
    -   **Description**: Create a central dashboard that provides a **high-level overview and visual insights** into key business metrics.
    -   **Vision**: Summary cards for *Total Employees*, *Total Overtime This Month*, and *Total Payouts*. Interactive charts to visualize overtime trends and help in resource management.

-   ### ✏️ **Full CRUD Functionality**
    -   **Description**: Enhance the application with full **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** capabilities for all records.
    -   **Vision**: "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for employee profiles and individual attendance records, complete with confirmation modals to prevent accidental data loss.
